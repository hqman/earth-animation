## Claude 3.7 Empowers UI Designers! üöÄ

This 3D Earth Animation [Demo ](https://3d-earth.hqman.us)
 was made with just one image and a simple prompt. 
My experience has been both surprising and amazing! ‚ú®

Claude 3.7 was just released recently, and its programming capabilities have improved tremendously compared to the previous generation. 
Especially in generating UI/UX designs! üéØ

After experimenting with friends, we've discovered two effective approaches:

If you have a design reference (image or Figma):
- Simply drop the image into Cursor or Trae
- Select Claude 3.7
- Use simple prompts to generate high-quality UI pages
- Similar method works with Figma through MCP

- Find a well-designed page you like
- Provide the HTML/code as a reference to the model
- Add your prompts to generate high-quality UI interfaces

### Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è

- Trae (Currently offers Claude 3.7 for free)
- Cursor (Similar usage, slightly different results)
